## WASM Tetris

Tetris clone on canvas using WebAssembly in Rust.
I wrote this to get my feet wet with web technologies and learnt a lot in the process!

## Running this locally

Before running this locally, you must have all of these installed.

- Rust
- Cargo
- wasm-pack (`cargo install wasm-pack`)

- yarn

When you have all the prerequisites installed, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.
